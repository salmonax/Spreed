What's This?
----------------

It's simple speed-reading app based on Spritz and cobbled together for my own personal use. It uses [assbb's Green Shoes](https://github.com/ashbb/green_shoes) for the GUI.

This is really just a practice project, so if you're looking for something that actually does what it's supposed to, you may want to check out [OpenSpritz](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz) or one of the sister projects listed in its readme.

I am in no way affiliated with Spritz Incorporated. This in an open source project created for pure fun.
